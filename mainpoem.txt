Physics reminds me of tortoises!
It can't swim!

Physics is really great! There is nothing less I hate!
Physics is great
Except is takes years off my life
Which is nice... I guess


I'm not creative.
I'm still not creative.
But here goes something.

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I was into this,
Until everyone knew.

I just lost the game.
Oh no
